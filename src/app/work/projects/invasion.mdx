# Invasion

### By Rohan Kumar

## Overview

**Invasion** is a third-person shooter where players must defend the last 25 civilians on Earth from an alien invasion. With a variety of weapons and strategic gameplay mechanics, players must fend off waves of aliens and protect humanity from extinction.

## Features

- **Wave-Based Combat**: Survive increasingly difficult waves of alien attackers.
- **Multiple Weapon Types**: Use an arsenal of weapons, including:
  - **Base Assault Rifle**: Medium-range, automatic fire.
  - **Golden Pistol**: High damage, low fire rate.
  - **Rocket Sniper**: Long-range, splash-damage rockets.
- **Dynamic AI Behavior**: Different alien types with unique abilities and behaviors.
- **Civilian AI**: Civilians react dynamically to threats and must be protected.
- **Replayability**: Procedurally spawned enemies and multiple strategies for success.

## High-Level Design

- **Type**: Third-Person Shooter  
- **Target Audience**: 10-40 years old  
- **Tone**: Goofy and light-hearted with cartoony visuals  
- **Theme**: "Protect by shooting"—Save civilians by exterminating alien threats.  

## Controls

- **Movement**: `WASD`  
- **Sprint**: `Shift` (limited duration)  
- **Jump**: `Spacebar`  
- **Reload**: `R`  
- **Aim and Shoot**: Mouse  

## Alien Types and AI Pathfinding

### 1. Player Attacker
- **Goal**: Disable the player’s guns and attack civilians while the player is defenseless.  
- **Pathfinding**: Targets the player first, then switches to civilians when the player is disabled.  
- **Behavior**: Updates targets dynamically based on proximity.

### 2. Bounty Hunter
- **Goal**: Charges at civilians at high speed with no ability to change targets.  
- **Pathfinding**: Locks onto one civilian and moves in a straight path, ignoring obstacles.  
- **Behavior**: Does not update target once locked.

### 3. Tank
- **Goal**: Attacks civilians and explodes upon death, causing splash damage.  
- **Pathfinding**: Targets the nearest civilian and updates target every few seconds.  
- **Behavior**: Prioritizes civilians in groups to maximize damage.

### 4. Hypnosis Alien
- **Goal**: Hypnotizes civilians, pulling them closer until captured.  
- **Pathfinding**: Locks onto the nearest civilian and stops moving once within range.  
- **Behavior**: Does not switch targets after locking in.

## Game Loop

3. Use vending machines to upgrade weapons.
4. Survive until all waves are cleared or civilians are lost.

## Art and Sound Design

## How to Play

## Known Issues
